I'm currently studying Software Development at Fox Valley Technical College, as well as Game Development on my own time through Udemy. I'm going to graduate at the end of May 2023.

I graduated from the Manufacturing and Engineering Academy at Neenah High School in Neenah, WI. I worked as a bakery clerk for two years starting the summer before my junior year of high school, and then an additional year from 2020-2021. I'm an Eagle Scout. In high school I was a member of the National Honor Society. I'm extremely interested in video game development and working with Unreal Engine 5 in my spare time to make my own games.
